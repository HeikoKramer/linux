# LINUX 
## info
Public repo to backup my Linux configs and to keep track of my learning progress. <br>
[linux_notes.md](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/linux/blob/main/linux_notes.md) holds currently my combined notes on **bash** and **Linux** <br>
I've separated my notes on **vim** into [vim_notes.md](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/linux/blob/main/vim_notes.md) <br>
And my notes on **tmux** into [tmux_notes.md](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/linux/blob/main/tmux_notes.md) <br>
## scripts
[scripts/](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/linux/tree/main/scripts) holds interesting scripts I've copied or written. The directory is exported to my path to make them executable from my shell. <br>
## dotfiles
[dotfiles/](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/linux/tree/main/dotfiles) stores my most relevant config files and a *setup* script which links those files to my home directory. <br>
### dotfiles/remot
[remote/](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/linux/tree/main/dotfiles/remote) stores reduced versions of my *dotfiles* which I'm using as a default setup on any new remote systems. <br>
