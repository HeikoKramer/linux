# LINUX 
## info
Public repo to backup my Linux configs and to keep track of my learning progress. <br>
**linux_notes.md** holds currently my combined notes on **bash** and **Linux** <br>
I've separated my notes on **vim** into **vim_notes.md** <br>
## scripts
**scripts/** holds interesting scripts I've copied or written. The directory is exported to my path to make them executable from my shell. <br>
## dotfiles
**dotfiles/** stores my most relevant config files and a *setup* script which links those files to my home directory. <br>
### dotfiles/remot
**remote/** stores reduced versions of my *dotfiles* which I'm using as a default setup on any new remote systems. <br>
